# Lightweight-Fine-Tuning-to-a-Foundation-Model

This repository demonstrates a lightweight approach for fine-tuning pre-trained models using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The project includes scripts for training, evaluating, and logging model performance, making it easier to adapt pre-trained models to your custom datasets.

## Features

- **Efficient Fine-Tuning:** Uses mixed precision (fp16) when a GPU is available to speed up training.
- **Evaluation Pipeline:** Supports evaluation on a custom test dataset with configurable batch sizes.
- **Easy Configuration:** Modify training arguments such as batch size, logging frequency, and evaluation dataset subset.
- **Extensible Metrics:** Plug in custom metrics using the `compute_metrics` function.

## Project Structure

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the fine-tuning workflow.
- **scripts/**: Training and evaluation scripts.
- **results/**: Directory where model outputs and checkpoints are saved.
- **logs/**: Directory for logging training progress and evaluation metrics.
- **README.md**: This file.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python packages.
